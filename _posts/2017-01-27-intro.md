This is my first post. I will be putting up research related information up here from time to time. Maybe some personal things as well. Please refer to my [CV](/cv/) for recent publications. I will be starting a new position at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute ([met.no](http://met.no)) in February. I will be working on projects associated with data assimilation in an Arctic marine forecasting model. My research background is predominantly associated with observations of small-scale phenomena in the ocean and I'm looking forward to using this knowledge in the macroscopic world of numerical prediction.
